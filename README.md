## System Overview

### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Purpose

This document outlines the requirements for the development of a robust License Management and Validation System for Software as a Service (SAAS), ensuring secure and centralized license validation.

#### 1.2 Scope

The system will be integrated into all SAAS products, validating licenses by connecting to a central server, enhancing control and security.

#### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

- SAAS: Software as a Service
- LMS: License Management System

### 2. System Overview

#### 2.1 System Description

The License Management and Validation System validates licenses for SAAS products, employing strong security measures to prevent unauthorized access or tampering.

#### 2.2 System Architecture

The architecture, inspired by Microsoft's principles, consists of:

- **Client-Side Component**
  - **License Validator:**
    - Embed into every SAAS product.
    - Communicates with the central server securely.
    - Securely stores license information locally.

- **Central Server Component**
  - **License Management Server:**
    - Hosted on a secure cloud infrastructure.
    - Handles license validation requests.
    - Manages the central database of valid licenses.
  - **Database:**
    - Stores encrypted license data.

- **Administrative Interface**
  - **Web-based Dashboard:**
    - Allows administrators to manage licenses.
    - Implements role-based access control.

### 3. Functional Requirements

#### 3.1 License Validation

- **Client-Server Communication:**
  - Secure communication with industry-standard encryption.
  - Asynchronous communication to minimize latency.

- **License Activation:**
  - Secure process initiated by the client.

- **Offline Mode:**
  - Support for limited functionality when the client cannot connect temporarily.

#### 3.2 License Management

- **Centralized License Storage:**
  - Central database containing all valid licenses.

- **License Revocation:**
  - Administrators can revoke licenses in case of misuse or security concerns.

#### 3.3 Security

- **Data Encryption:**
  - Industry-standard encryption for communication and stored data.

- **Authentication:**
  - Multi-factor authentication for administrator access.

- **Authorization:**
  - Role-based access control for administrators.

- **License Integrity Checks:**
  - Mechanisms to ensure the integrity of licenses during transmission and storage.

- **Security Auditing:**
  - Logging of relevant activities for auditing purposes.

#### 3.4 Reporting and Monitoring

- **Usage Statistics:**
  - Detailed statistics for administrators.

- **Alerts and Notifications:**
  - Alert system for suspicious activities, license expirations, or security breaches.

### 4. Non-functional Requirements

#### 4.1 Performance

- **Scalability:**
  - System must handle a growing number of clients and license validation requests.

- **Response Time:**
  - License validation requests within acceptable limits, even during peak usage.

#### 4.2 Reliability
